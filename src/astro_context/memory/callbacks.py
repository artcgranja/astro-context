"""Callback protocol for memory operation observability.

Provides a ``MemoryCallback`` protocol that mirrors the approach used by
``PipelineCallback`` in ``pipeline/callbacks.py``.  All methods have
default no-op implementations so that partial implementations are valid.

The ``_fire_memory_callback`` helper iterates over a list of callbacks,
calling the named method on each one and swallowing any exception so that
a buggy callback can never crash a memory operation.
